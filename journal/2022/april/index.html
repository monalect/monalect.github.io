  <h1>April</h1>

<h2 id="april-26">April 26</h2>
<p><strong>Time Worked:</strong> 6 hours</p>
<h2 id="april-27">April 27</h2>
<p>[6:53am] </p>
<p>The first day I'm writing here. I have another dev journal, but I'll start anew here.</p>
<p>Last night, I quickly setup the new design for the landing page that's a step better than before. Today I'll set things up to use in Next.js. I set it up enough that I had a complete system, but I'll want to revisit the styling. I used Next's module css system, but found that they want you to use their own classing system. I thought it would be better to develop it seperately in Sass, and just globally import what's necessary, which should be almost all of it.</p>
<p>The new design uses a fun color scheme. I'll want to play around with it later to create more components. I noticed an issue with some of the button colors, so I'll want to expand my color palette a bit. I'm using a gradient scheme, but it clashes with semantic colors as the opposite side of the gradient is a maroon red, which means it can't really be used for button color. Anyways, I'll figure it out. I'll just probably switch up the gradient with an academic gold. </p>
<p>For now, I'll quickly write up the landing page, which shouldn't take much time and "setup", the only 3 components I see are the header, text-input, and button, with the latter two being omitted in the final product until I can setup an API to take in the email.</p>
<p>Anywho, for today, I'll have the landing done, then create the design for the blog which should take me the rest of the day, realistically. By the end I'll want to then organize my documentation here a little bit and have it out there.</p>
<p>I have a dentist's appointment. Hopefully it won't take too much time. It should just be a checkup, and I'll be back to work. </p>

<p>Looking back, I'm unhappy with my hours yesterday. I woke up early, and I should've been able to work for most of the day. I'll make up for it today.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on implementing the blog. I just wanted to add some things here to put on the blog later on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix loading jank (mostly caused by waiting for the css to load in google fonts, which after it's cached it doesn't become a problem, but I want to at least make the initial load clean)</li>
</ul>
<p>[3:04pm]</p>
<p>The blog is going to take some time, but I figured out how to set it up. The real problem so far is the mess that this is becoming. I'll really need to take a moment and break this website down when I eventually have to. For now, just finish it.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 7.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="april-29">April 29</h2>
<p>[7:13am]</p>
<p>I'm still surprised I only worked seven and a half hours yesterday. It felt much longer. I blame the fact that I forget to turn the timer on and still work.</p>
<p>But, I finished the blog finally. I'll have to rewrite my first post, as it's something I rambled together quickly to just have up there when I make it live for the first time. A few things to remember for later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add social media support<ul>
<li>personal social media (of author &gt;.&gt;)</li>
<li>share with others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make all pages responsive</li>
<li>Make the blog header a link with a hover style</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I'm just going to be refactoring and reorganizing code. I made a mess creating the website last night, I just want to have it cleaned. Then I'll create the designs for the "Plans" and "About Me" section, which shouldn't take too long.</p>
<p>I'll think of how to reorganize it here because it's a bit of a confusion. So I can split it up into two things to organize: Style, and code. The SASS styling can be split up further into page styles, and then component styles. Page styles will be imported into the main, global sass file.</p>
<p>I'll want to break up the page into various components then, and show that through code. Then I'll go through their styles.</p>
<p>There are some things that are tricky. The header, for example, highlights depending on what's the current active link or path. If a turn it into a component, I need some way to check. I think I can do it easily enough however by simply making it a prop that tells the link what path is active, and then subsequently adds an active class to the active link.</p>
<p>I'll also want to create a better design system. So far, only the colors are really part of the "system", and perhaps some components. But I can make it better.</p>
<p>One of the things is whether I use a tagging system like .mn--post-card.mn--small or just .mn--post-card-small for the component class. </p>
<p>Some research is necessary. I'll look into Sass styling architectures.</p>
<p>[7:57am]</p>
<p>Whenever I do Sass styling, I don't do any form of nesting. Perhaps I should.</p>
<p>[10:11am]</p>
<p>Okay, I've cleaned <em>a bit</em>. Not enough, but enough that I can work on the next two pages without feeling messy. </p>
<p>After finishing the surface-site (I'm calling it that, I can't figure out a name), I'll go on to create the design system a little more thoroughly. </p>
<p>But now, I got to return to the documentation and finishing up my user stories. I'll put this page up using github pages instead of cloudflare's pages.</p>
<p>[11:56am]</p>
<p>Done, although there wasn't much to do. Next thing I want to do is create the plans and about me section. I'll clean it up a bit more, and then begin work on the design system. Ah, actually I have a bit more to do. I'll want to set up the tasklist for the design system.</p>
<p>I thought to make user stories with it, but I think there's a limit to how much I can stretch the concept. I'll instead just create a normal tasklist.</p>
<p>[2:14pm]</p>
<p>My breaks are becoming too long, a sign that I'm becoming disinterested. Not very good. I have to create a feature page now, and I realized I needed to create content.</p>
<p>However, the content I create will have to be in static html. I think I'm going to make it a markdown file that nextjs automatically renders, as I'll likely have to update it and I'm not going to deal with the mess of editing html. I'll create the content first, then integrate it.</p>
<p>[8:10pm]</p>
<p>I haven't done as much as I wished today. I worked a lot, but a good chunk of it had been spent writing rambly content for my website. I finished the the website, but I rushed the about me and "vision" page so it's a bit sloppy, but I'll improve them eventually.</p>
<p>I'll want to focus now on getting a start on the design system. I'll decide later whether to come back on them and improve them with my designed system. For now, a lot of typing and creative thinking. Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 9 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="april-30">April 30</h2>
<p>[9:17am]</p>
<p>Woke up a little later today, but that's okay. Today I'm just creating the first iteration of the design system. There are some things that can be improved from the work I did yesterday, mostly under the "language" part of it. There's also the concern of accessibility which I find myself having trouble with. The guidelines aren't just "do this for this", they use a lot of jargon and technical stuff that makes it more complicated than it needs to be. But that's the nature of standards, usually.</p>
<p>I'll just have to go through it. I don't have to care about accessibility on a personal project, but I find importance and obligation in it. If I would help a blind man cross my street, then I would help a blind man navigate my website. And it goes with other disabilities as well. It's just basic human decency, especially if my project is something they find value in. The biggest danger is that I feel it isn't important enough, but I will try regardless.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got to work on the dsign system today. I highly doubt I'll finish it today, but I'll want to set up a new repository where I can work on creating all the components without needing to feel tied to it.</p>
<p>A concern is typography. Working on a font requires a lot more study, research, and experience than I'm willing to put in this early into the design. I went with IBM's Plex font so far, but I think I'll check out Knuth's Computer Modern just for the nerdyness of it.</p>
<p>[10:52am]</p>
<p>Okay, I'm sticking with the IBM typography.</p>
<p>[11:37am]</p>
<p>AAGHGHGHAAHGH. I hate colour schemes. I've been stuck on this for an hour and a half, trying to pick colours. I have a colour scheme already, but it uses cool colours, and I wanted my website to be warm. However, warm colours look ugly.</p>
<p>Bah, I'm an academic website, I don't need to be warm.</p>
<p>Agh, and I have to create icons and stuff too. Or at least find some. Okay, I can do this, but I need a space I can collect all of my stuff in so I can use later.</p>
<p>[11:50am]</p>
<p>I got in in way over my head. Is it too late? The thing is, going with a design system can become limiting. </p>
<p>But okay, lets split this up into manageable pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I create a new repository for my design system?<ul>
<li>No, that is insane. Work within the website itself using sass and components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do I need to have a css grid system instead of a flex-box system for my design?<ul>
<li>That's the way design systems seem to lean towards, however it's not that simple. </li>
<li>It's more like how padding, margins, sizing and spacing is made consistent. So for example, allowing only options of 16px, 24px, 32px.</li>
<li>Apparently, people in Sass make their own grid system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do I organize my design system? Where do I create it then if I can't make a repository?<ul>
<li>You organize it in your website through components and sass.</li>
<li>Don't create a design system, just create the seeds of one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I'm working on a very large project, I feel a design system is necessary if I wish to extend it, update it and maintain it easily. It'll allow me to also learn and think of my website in an organized method.<ul>
<li><em>fine</em></li>
<li>Use storybook to build your design system components.</li>
<li>Use figma for coming up with the actual designs of these components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do i know what components to use?<ul>
<li>You don't. Your project can turn a many ways.</li>
<li>Instead create components that are universally </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[1:01p]</p>
<p>Storybook looks promising. They have a nice article on creating a design system that I want to look at after figuring out how to use storybook. It doesn't address things like spacing, and Sass however. I think I'll just use the Carbon Design System's method, which is to just make the sass seperate from the JSX component exports. Then after that you create a folder that contains all the components in a holistic style.</p>
<p>[2:16pm]</p>
<p>I set up storybook, now I'm dealing with the problem of figuring out what buttons I need. Okay, so now to create a whole system, I'll need storybook to use a main.scss file, using a sass folder that I have.</p>
<p>I'll want to look into proper class creation in sass. For now, lets create a simple button component. </p>
<p>[3:27pm]</p>
<p>I created it, but I'm unhappy with the way storybook displays css. It says it's a UI constructor, but their Sass support is horrid. Anyways, I made it work. What's the point of being a UI constructor, if it's hard to do basic styling?</p>
<p>Bah, anyways. Atleast it autoloads components into a system that I can see and manipulate fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I did look into class naming, and I'm going to follow this guy's: <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/">https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/</a></p>
<p>But my eyes are bleeding now. I've been staring at a screen for 4 hours straight trying to understand this. But now that I have something set up, I can begin work. I have to question how to organize sass. My components each have their own sass file, but I think I'll take everything and put it into a seperate sass folder to use. </p>
<p>[4:21pm]</p>
<p>My brain was turning to mush so I took a short break. Just a note for the future: Use GraphQL.</p>
<p>[9:16pm] </p>
<p>I'm calling it in for the day. A few things: I gave up with storybook. The way I wanted to implement my component styles, which was as a global sass stylesheet, was incompatable with it for some reason. I couldn't debug, so I just said "screw it" and made a Next.js app with an empty page that displays the components I set in. </p>
<p>So far the design is nice. I "finished" the buttons. I still have to do the "disabled" state of the button, but so far the buttons are usable. I'm working currently on the text input, and that should be enough for me to get started.</p>
<p>I questioned whether to even use figma for setting up my components, as it felt like I was set up to just make them in css anyways. At most, I'd figure out the layout, but I feel like I could do that on pen and paper, then just use the component method to implement it. </p>
<p>Today was one of those days where I worked a lot, but felt like progress was little. I have a design system started, but it's going to be a lot of work. I'll want to go through the design more efficiently and quickly. I'm going to use a free set of icons to use with my system as well. </p>
<p>Tomorrow I might take it a bit more easy. Struggling with storybook really took a lot of my energy away. I want to try and re-write my main website content, and then write a few ideas for interesting media to incorporate with my website. For some reason, I'm thinking of a small green tree, on a white pot. An ocean is out there. </p>
<p><img alt="A beautiful, minimal view of the ocean." src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9f/e3/48/9fe3480383916be37f3661baee128e8f.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sort of like that. But anyways, I'm going to go sleep now and wake up tomorrow. I want to think a little more about my plan, I'm getting a little lost over what I'm doing and want to stop designing. Now that I have the design method set up, I should be focusing instead on implementing features. Create components and designs based on the log-in form for example. I should try and create the tickets for monalect and start a trello board. </p>
<p>But anyways, I'm getting dead tired. I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

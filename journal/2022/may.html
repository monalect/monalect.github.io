<h1 id="may-2022">MAY 2022</h1>
<h2 id="may-1st">May 1st</h2>
<p>[5:23am]</p>
<p>I woke up very early through some troubled sleep. I know what it was because of, and it won't happen again. I'll use it as an opportunity, to sleep early again.  </p>
<p>Now let's do some overhauls on the current text content. For the documentation, I'll need to erase the design documentation and think of it a bit more professionally. In all likelihood, I'll likely have to create the design documentation as its own website, probably as the same folder of the next.js application.</p>
<p>I might just put it here as well, and have it become part of this website. We'll see. For now, let's just start over. </p>
<p>I'll then work on the website's text content, and make it more marketable, artistic and less manic. I'll want to import the SEO keywords from my other repository. </p>
<p>Later on, I'll want to make it a more visually pleasing and creative "vision" statement, one that isn't just a markdown document. It will make it intesive, and rather static in that it won't be as easy to change as the markdown document, thus the content change will be a step towards that eventual final design, which will incorporate elements and instruction gained from my design system.</p>
<p>For now, it's just a vision.</p>
<p>I'll want to edit my blog post as well. The vision statement illustrates Monalect in its philosophical, and its initial constructive form. The blog post will be on about the construction, the timeline, the planned features and what not. </p>
<p>After that, I'll want to get back to documentation here. I want to create the necessary tickets for my project. I'm not enjoying designing things based on guess instead of clear need. For example, when I want to design the buttons and the text inputs, I want it done when I choose the login user story to work on. I'll create the functional requirements, create the design, the backend, the frontend, and boom bop bam, I'll have it done. </p>
<p>One question I'll have to figure out is Jest. Jest is a pain in the ass because it's confusing. PyTest and Python's unit test library is fine and easy, I can figure that out, but Jest is very opaque to me for some reason. I'll figure it out eventually.</p>
<p>But okay, I have the day's work ahead of me, time to work.</p>
<p>[8:06am]</p>
<p>Done the new design document that detailed my plans and my expectations. I felt it wasn't necessary, but it remove my previous embarassment of a designsystem, and creates just a "plan" for it.  </p>
<p>Now I got to work on the vision statement and blog post.</p>
<p>This comes to writing guidelines to be honest, so I think I start creating something like that for my website. </p>
<p>[1:46pm]</p>
<p>My lack of sleep is coming back to haunt me. I can't focus too well anymore, and I'm becoming annoyed with writing. I thought it'd be a fairly relaxed thing, but it's just making me feel like I'm being unproductive, and writing fluff instead of working on what actually. I'll put it on the back burner for now then, and create the tickets for the project.</p>
<p>I'll be working on the user story for user management. The log in and fluff like that. Mail chimp here I come.</p>
<p>[8:01pm]</p>
<p>I think that's it for today. My tire has put me out for the past few hours, I think I'll just sleep and catch up on my work tomorrow.</p>
<p>I sort of finished the first user story. I'll want to edit the ticket to include a bit more detail, tasks and subtasks, then begin on the design, implement the backend, create the components.</p>
<p>If I get that far tomorrow, I'll want to learn a bit about the libraries I'm using. I want to go through the documentation a bit more thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-2nd">May 2nd</h2>
<p>[10:43am]</p>
<p>So I caught up on my sleep, although it was very shakey. I slept at 9pm, woke up at 12am, slept at 1am, woke up now at 9am. Hopefully it's enough for my brain to be content today. </p>
<p>Today I'll be doing as I said I'll do yesterday. I have something I need to do for my father as well, but that should be trivial. For now:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Edit User Ticket to Include More Detail</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Begin on design</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Implement Backend</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Create Frontend Components</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to change a bit and work on the marketing/writing part. I specifically want to get into metadata, and start thinking more deeply about the design for the blog, but only after this user story is done. The reason why I'm so strict on it is because marketing is a huge part of how this project will be shared and known. My worry is that going for the usual marketing that others do is not the way my target audience is. My target audience go to sci-hub and library genesis. They study things on apps using old UIs. I don't want to alienate them too much.</p>
<p>I'll just have to care about that in the design. But anyways, time to work.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 6 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-3rd">May 3rd</h2>
<p>[8:50am]</p>
<p>Didn't work as hard as I would've liked yesterday. It's mostly because I was also sleepy yesterday, and that the design was becoming messy. I wanted to do a lot of things that were nice. Things like a blurred background when the modal sign-up form appeared.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? <code>backdrop-filter: blur(4px);</code> right? Isn't supported on firefox, and I use firefox. So I have to do a hack where I split up the screen into two: the <code>div</code> with the modal, and the <code>div</code> that contains everything else. When the modal is shown, it blurs. </p>
<p>And it works so far, I just have to make it now so that when I click outside of the element, it hides the modal. However, I used flexbox to place it, which means the parent element covers everything. It's a quandary.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of modifying the z-index of the parent modal, and the modal's content. That should work it out.</p>
<p>But yea, I know what I'm working on today. There is something else I'll have to figure out, integrating my design system as a package with my frontend. </p>
<p>I'll want to do it after I'm done all the components, and I clean them up a little.</p>
<p>But so far, it's taking longer than I thought. I still haven't worked on the backend, and that's the biggest question. Who knows, maybe the backend is actually easy, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>Off to work.</p>
<p>[11:28am]</p>
<p>Finally done the front end. Everything should work beautifully, and my initial solution didn't work, but the second one did and was far easier than I would've thought. It was the type of solution I felt stupid over, involving the change of state from the child component, which I assumed was impossible because you're not supposed to change passed inherited props I thought it would extend there, but alas.</p>
<p>All that's left is clean up and integration. </p>
<p>Clean up will be tricky as I have no idea where to start on it. I feel like auditing and setting up a standard would be good, but it involves knowing what to audit.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll want to try and do that. Create an auditing system for my frontend components.</p>
<p>For now, I'll work on backend, taking a break from frontend, then I'll work on frontend packaging and integration.</p>
<p>[2:29pm]</p>
<p>This is great. I have two libraries to figure out quickly. FastAPI and strawberry-graphql. I'll need to figure out GraphQL itself before that as well. What fun, what fun stuff, really.</p>
<p>I'll put my notes here.</p>
<p>[3:21pm]</p>
<p>I've renewed my hate for studying, ugh. I'm reading the GraphQL documentation and it's not fun. I'll want to set a stopping point somewhere, work to that, and then move on to learning fastapi and strawberry-graphql very quickly so I can start implementing it. </p>
<p>[3:56pm]</p>
<p>I'm going to fastapi-users for this, but I'm only lamenting the fact that I have so much stuff to learn. It's like adding onto a pile. It's very confusing. I'll have it conquered eventually.</p>
<p>Also I'm going to stop there. I haven't yet read into the schema tab, and I'll want to do that later, but I really want to figure out the more important things like fastapi, and then revisit my sqlalchemy notes.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 8.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-4">May 4</h2>
<p>[6:16am]</p>
<p>I figured out a bug that had me salty all of last night. It was such a stupid bug. Apparently you have to delete the sqlite3 database for Sqlalchemy to update its schema, but I spent hours reading it trying to figure out if something was wrong with my code. It turns out there wasn't.</p>
<p>Anyways, today I got to continue setting it up. Yesterday I decided to give up with fastapi but I'm deciding against it today. It's a useful api for what I'm doing, but also reading and following my code for a few hours has made me understand it a lot better.</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to integrate the GraphQL library im using with fastapi-users. I think it'll rely on the dependency structure, but I'll want to play around with it to figure it out. </p>
<p>As for yesterday, I worked more than I expected. I'm still not hitting those numbers I want like 10 or 12 hours, but today's a start.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 5.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-5">May 5</h2>
<p>[9:16am]</p>
<p>It turns out sleeping poorly decreases work performance. I restarded everything, I removed fastapi-users and created my own implementation. I just have to finish it today. </p>
<p>One thing I'm happy about is how much   I've come to learn about python. I feel like I can navigate through python a lot better now using dependencies and decorator functions. The next thing to learn is asynchronous python, and getting more used to Pydantic. </p>
<p>I should allot some time to learning instead of working.</p>
<p>But anyways, today I got to finish the backend implementation. I'm going for a cookie structure with database. It's stateful but I don't really care for REST adherence. </p>
<p>[5:34pm]</p>
<p>I'm brain-dead. I've reached the point where I'm becoming lazy with my code. I set up user registration with optional email registration, and all I have to do now is set up validation and exception handling in a clean way. </p>
<p>User login and authentication need to be figured out still, but I know how to do it.</p>
<p>It's taking me a lot longer than I wished, mostly because I'm getting used to the news stack I decided to go with. So far, I have it in my dead.</p>
<p>For now, I'm going to go back to frontend and set things up so I can have my components be locally packaged, and I can use them with my frontend generator. It requires that I set a couple of components first however.</p>
<p>So far, that's it. I'm going to take a break now, cool off my head, and then I'll be back soon after to do what I set out to do.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 6.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-6">May 6</h2>
<p>[8:12am]</p>
<p>I stopped work after that last entry. I think backend work is proving to be more brain intensive than I expected. It'll take time to build up an endurance to staring at something that doesn't work for hours.</p>
<p>For today, I'll be working on frontend, creating the package, integrating it with the website and setting up the user form in frontend to interact with. I'll then continue onto backend, finishing up captcha, and then organizing things a little more better. I'll want to store my things in seperate files, and make it more airtight.</p>

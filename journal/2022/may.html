<h1 id="may">May</h1>
<h2 id="may-1">May 1</h2>
<p>[5:23am]</p>
<p>I woke up very early through some troubled sleep. I know what it was because of, and it won't happen again. I'll use it as an opportunity, to sleep early again.  </p>
<p>Now let's do some overhauls on the current text content. For the documentation, I'll need to erase the design documentation and think of it a bit more professionally. In all likelihood, I'll likely have to create the design documentation as its own website, probably as the same folder of the next.js application.</p>
<p>I might just put it here as well, and have it become part of this website. We'll see. For now, let's just start over. </p>
<p>I'll then work on the website's text content, and make it more marketable, artistic and less manic. I'll want to import the SEO keywords from my other repository. </p>
<p>Later on, I'll want to make it a more visually pleasing and creative "vision" statement, one that isn't just a markdown document. It will make it intesive, and rather static in that it won't be as easy to change as the markdown document, thus the content change will be a step towards that eventual final design, which will incorporate elements and instruction gained from my design system.</p>
<p>For now, it's just a vision.</p>
<p>I'll want to edit my blog post as well. The vision statement illustrates Monalect in its philosophical, and its initial constructive form. The blog post will be on about the construction, the timeline, the planned features and what not. </p>
<p>After that, I'll want to get back to documentation here. I want to create the necessary tickets for my project. I'm not enjoying designing things based on guess instead of clear need. For example, when I want to design the buttons and the text inputs, I want it done when I choose the login user story to work on. I'll create the functional requirements, create the design, the backend, the frontend, and boom bop bam, I'll have it done. </p>
<p>One question I'll have to figure out is Jest. Jest is a pain in the ass because it's confusing. PyTest and Python's unit test library is fine and easy, I can figure that out, but Jest is very opaque to me for some reason. I'll figure it out eventually.</p>
<p>But okay, I have the day's work ahead of me, time to work.</p>
<p>[8:06am]</p>
<p>Done the new design document that detailed my plans and my expectations. I felt it wasn't necessary, but it remove my previous embarassment of a designsystem, and creates just a "plan" for it.  </p>
<p>Now I got to work on the vision statement and blog post.</p>
<p>This comes to writing guidelines to be honest, so I think I start creating something like that for my website. </p>
<p>[1:46pm]</p>
<p>My lack of sleep is coming back to haunt me. I can't focus too well anymore, and I'm becoming annoyed with writing. I thought it'd be a fairly relaxed thing, but it's just making me feel like I'm being unproductive, and writing fluff instead of working on what actually. I'll put it on the back burner for now then, and create the tickets for the project.</p>
<p>I'll be working on the user story for user management. The log in and fluff like that. Mail chimp here I come.</p>
<p>[8:01pm]</p>
<p>I think that's it for today. My tire has put me out for the past few hours, I think I'll just sleep and catch up on my work tomorrow.</p>
<p>I sort of finished the first user story. I'll want to edit the ticket to include a bit more detail, tasks and subtasks, then begin on the design, implement the backend, create the components.</p>
<p>If I get that far tomorrow, I'll want to learn a bit about the libraries I'm using. I want to go through the documentation a bit more thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-2">May 2</h2>
<p>[10:43am]</p>
<p>So I caught up on my sleep, although it was very shakey. I slept at 9pm, woke up at 12am, slept at 1am, woke up now at 9am. Hopefully it's enough for my brain to be content today. </p>
<p>Today I'll be doing as I said I'll do yesterday. I have something I need to do for my father as well, but that should be trivial. For now:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Edit User Ticket to Include More Detail</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Begin on design</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Implement Backend</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Create Frontend Components</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to change a bit and work on the marketing/writing part. I specifically want to get into metadata, and start thinking more deeply about the design for the blog, but only after this user story is done. The reason why I'm so strict on it is because marketing is a huge part of how this project will be shared and known. My worry is that going for the usual marketing that others do is not the way my target audience is. My target audience go to sci-hub and library genesis. They study things on apps using old UIs. I don't want to alienate them too much.</p>
<p>I'll just have to care about that in the design. But anyways, time to work.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 6 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-3">May 3</h2>
<p>[8:50am]</p>
<p>Didn't work as hard as I would've liked yesterday. It's mostly because I was also sleepy yesterday, and that the design was becoming messy. I wanted to do a lot of things that were nice. Things like a blurred background when the modal sign-up form appeared.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? <code>backdrop-filter: blur(4px);</code> right? Isn't supported on firefox, and I use firefox. So I have to do a hack where I split up the screen into two: the <code>div</code> with the modal, and the <code>div</code> that contains everything else. When the modal is shown, it blurs. </p>
<p>And it works so far, I just have to make it now so that when I click outside of the element, it hides the modal. However, I used flexbox to place it, which means the parent element covers everything. It's a quandary.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of modifying the z-index of the parent modal, and the modal's content. That should work it out.</p>
<p>But yea, I know what I'm working on today. There is something else I'll have to figure out, integrating my design system as a package with my frontend. </p>
<p>I'll want to do it after I'm done all the components, and I clean them up a little.</p>
<p>But so far, it's taking longer than I thought. I still haven't worked on the backend, and that's the biggest question. Who knows, maybe the backend is actually easy, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>Off to work.</p>
<p>[11:28am]</p>
<p>Finally done the front end. Everything should work beautifully, and my initial solution didn't work, but the second one did and was far easier than I would've thought. It was the type of solution I felt stupid over, involving the change of state from the child component, which I assumed was impossible because you're not supposed to change passed inherited props I thought it would extend there, but alas.</p>
<p>All that's left is clean up and integration. </p>
<p>Clean up will be tricky as I have no idea where to start on it. I feel like auditing and setting up a standard would be good, but it involves knowing what to audit.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll want to try and do that. Create an auditing system for my frontend components.</p>
<p>For now, I'll work on backend, taking a break from frontend, then I'll work on frontend packaging and integration.</p>
<p>[2:29pm]</p>
<p>This is great. I have two libraries to figure out quickly. FastAPI and strawberry-graphql. I'll need to figure out GraphQL itself before that as well. What fun, what fun stuff, really.</p>
<p>I'll put my notes here.</p>
<p>[3:21pm]</p>
<p>I've renewed my hate for studying, ugh. I'm reading the GraphQL documentation and it's not fun. I'll want to set a stopping point somewhere, work to that, and then move on to learning fastapi and strawberry-graphql very quickly so I can start implementing it. </p>
<p>[3:56pm]</p>
<p>I'm going to fastapi-users for this, but I'm only lamenting the fact that I have so much stuff to learn. It's like adding onto a pile. It's very confusing. I'll have it conquered eventually.</p>
<p>Also I'm going to stop there. I haven't yet read into the schema tab, and I'll want to do that later, but I really want to figure out the more important things like fastapi, and then revisit my sqlalchemy notes.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 8.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-4">May 4</h2>
<p>[6:16am]</p>
<p>I figured out a bug that had me salty all of last night. It was such a stupid bug. Apparently you have to delete the sqlite3 database for Sqlalchemy to update its schema, but I spent hours reading it trying to figure out if something was wrong with my code. It turns out there wasn't.</p>
<p>Anyways, today I got to continue setting it up. Yesterday I decided to give up with fastapi but I'm deciding against it today. It's a useful api for what I'm doing, but also reading and following my code for a few hours has made me understand it a lot better.</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to integrate the GraphQL library im using with fastapi-users. I think it'll rely on the dependency structure, but I'll want to play around with it to figure it out. </p>
<p>As for yesterday, I worked more than I expected. I'm still not hitting those numbers I want like 10 or 12 hours, but today's a start.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 5.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-5">May 5</h2>
<p>[9:16am]</p>
<p>It turns out sleeping poorly decreases work performance. I restarded everything, I removed fastapi-users and created my own implementation. I just have to finish it today. </p>
<p>One thing I'm happy about is how much   I've come to learn about python. I feel like I can navigate through python a lot better now using dependencies and decorator functions. The next thing to learn is asynchronous python, and getting more used to Pydantic. </p>
<p>I should allot some time to learning instead of working.</p>
<p>But anyways, today I got to finish the backend implementation. I'm going for a cookie structure with database. It's stateful but I don't really care for REST adherence. </p>
<p>[5:34pm]</p>
<p>I'm brain-dead. I've reached the point where I'm becoming lazy with my code. I set up user registration with optional email registration, and all I have to do now is set up validation and exception handling in a clean way. </p>
<p>User login and authentication need to be figured out still, but I know how to do it.</p>
<p>It's taking me a lot longer than I wished, mostly because I'm getting used to the news stack I decided to go with. So far, I have it in my dead.</p>
<p>For now, I'm going to go back to frontend and set things up so I can have my components be locally packaged, and I can use them with my frontend generator. It requires that I set a couple of components first however.</p>
<p>So far, that's it. I'm going to take a break now, cool off my head, and then I'll be back soon after to do what I set out to do.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 6.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-6">May 6</h2>
<p>[8:12am]</p>
<p>I stopped work after that last entry. I think backend work is proving to be more brain intensive than I expected. It'll take time to build up an endurance to staring at something that doesn't work for hours.</p>
<p>For today, I'll be working on frontend, creating the package, integrating it with the website and setting up the user form in frontend to interact with. I'll then continue onto backend, finishing up captcha, and then organizing things a little more better. I'll want to store my things in seperate files, and make it more airtight.</p>
<p>[1:22pm]</p>
<p>So I finished with it, but I'm not going to use npm's system. I just created a bash script to copy-paste it into the repository.</p>
<p>It will make it skip node_modules.</p>
<p>I'm going to go back to backend now, and clean things up a little.</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest, I'm a little annoyed by the mess of everything so far. When I work on things, it's becoming half-assed which is not good for quality.</p>
<p>I think it's mostly because I'm not creating something I'm seeing, or monalect itself. I was having a lot of fun with frontend and creating the shallow site because I should it off. </p>
<p>I have a motivation to improve it more as well. I think I should go back to working on it a bit more, writing down some improvements I can make before I integrate user registration.</p>
<p>I realize I can just host my frontend app on cloudflare pages and it'll work out fine.</p>
<p>But anyways, I want to go back to working on frontend, so I'm going to re-vamp my shallow website design and its marketing.</p>
<p>[7:33pm]</p>
<p>I finished my first user story. Technically finished. Everything is done and implemented, but it's very messy and things like exception handling and user feedback aren't done well. Regardless, it <em>works</em> if a user registers the right way, it should work.</p>
<p>It means I'm going to have to go back and clean things up tomorrow, preferably everywhere. It'll be a little intensive, so while the programming is still fresh in my mind, I'll write a list.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" disabled/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Frontend, fully integrate the design system into the front-end. The frontend shouldn't create any of its own components.</li>

</ul>
<p>So that's it for now. I still have some time in the day. I've eaten my last meal and brushed my teeth so I'll be winding down. Regardless, I've only done seven and a half hours worth of work, and I want to up those numbers, so after cooling down, I'll spend the time working on the marketing.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of creating textbook maps, with prerequisites. </p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 7.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-7">May 7</h2>
<p>[9:27am]</p>
<p>I know what's set before me today, but it's taking a while for my meds and coffee to kick in, so I'm going to take it pretty easy at first. I want to go over the shallow site and improve it quite a bit so I can show it off to others.</p>
<p>I'll put the list here, then I'll do the list before. I won't be doing the work to improve it, I simply want to set it up to be able to do it later on. I want a clear idea of marketing and improvement.</p>
<p>[1:11pm]</p>
<p>I went through a bit of the digital marketing course, but still have more to go. </p>
<p>I realize I have to split myself up into multiple roles, and so far I'm learning about them. The marketer, the designer, the frontend developer, and the backend developer. The frontend developer is closer to the first three, as a direct implementation of their work, than the backend developer. </p>
<p>I assume soon I'll also have to take on the sub-roles within each role as well, which should be just great.</p>
<p>I can divide up my time. Because marketing is fairly seperate from the product, and for things related to it, I don't have to spend much time communicating with the product team. I'll save marketing for the morning to brighten up my day.</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest, marketing sounds really interesting to me. It's like playing a game, and trying to pump up numbers, much like Monalect will be for studying.</p>
<p>I'm going to stop with the course for now, and go through my website a bit more, taking notes on what marketing elements to fit it with, and putting those to completion.</p>
<p>[2:52pm]</p>
<p>This is very hard. I'm unsure of what to put. So far I have the idea of putting a contents section on the side that jumps to the contents. It'll have to make use of either meta-data or whatever to implement.</p>
<p>I think what's so hard about it is I'm too scared to change too much.</p>
<p>Let's focus on content then, and come back to that later. I'll want to set up a content creation framework. </p>
<p>[3:27pm]</p>
<p>I want to set up a weekly schedule now where I retain to certain habits. Things like taking sunday to review the way I learn and work, and setting about improving that.</p>
<p>[5:43pm]</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel sick. My limbs feel weak, a headache is forming and breathing is becoming weird. I can't really do anything high focus, so I'm just going to focus on content creation. Have something done that I can put up there in my blog.</p>
<p>I'm feeling bothered as well for some reason. I've hit that point where I'm beginning to become annoyed with my work. I begin to feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. I thought looking through my front-facing site will give me ideas that I can implement. I dislike the design, it's <em>too</em> minimal, and the gradient is too against the curve.</p>
<p>It's because I broke on the figma design system. God, there's too much work to do.</p>
<p>I'll just have to re-organize my life today.</p>
<p>So first things first, how do I split up my work. I'm using the agile method to work on the app itself, but I'm also doing marketing in order to get users onto it before I publish it.</p>
<p>Marketing is going to become important for me getting users and developing a brand or image. But isn't this supposed to be just a side project?</p>
<p>If this is how it feels everytime I go back and re-improve my work, it'll quickly become exhausting. But it's okay. If I do it right, I just have to do it once to set up the process. What I mean by that is, by organizing up something like my backend for scaling, then I wouldn't have to think so much about it. Everything should have its place.</p>
<p>I'm going to pull out my notebook and work on backend organization after this.</p>
<p>But back to marketing. This isn't a side project anymore, that much is clear, but it's not a full-fledged startup either. It's in a limbo between the two, and so I can afford some measure of informality in my blogging. I can use it for creating personality/brand.</p>
<p>But I feel a bit hopeless doing those things. I struggle often with social media and trying to put myself out there so people see me, let alone trying to go through an organization to show it off.</p>
<p>The better thing would be for me to interspace Monalect with more personal writing and philosophy like I have here, but I'd want to seperate it from my marketing blogs.</p>
<p>I'll have to put myself out there as well if I want this whole marketing thing to work-- but that's where it falters. I want something to show before I put myself out there.</p>
<p>So what's the play?</p>
<p>I'll need to create basic content first off. Then I need to put my website out there with the domain name, which I'll want to do after creating material they could be interested in.</p>
<p>So should I take marketing this seriously? I have to answer this question now before I waste so much time on it. If Monalect is going to be a product, then yes, I should take marketing very seriously.</p>
<p>Do I think of Monalect as a product? In every way it seems I do. My idea is, I work on it for free at first as a project, and then once I get users and I notice a market for it actually exists, then I'll switch over to startup mode. Register the company, start figuring out ways to monetize, etc.</p>
<p>But that's a problem for later. If I want to reach that point, I'll have to have development down. This means more than just implementing things I already know how to do. I can't be content with simple data manipulation. I'll have to get down and dirty with my libaries, and understand my tools thoroughly.</p>
<p>I'd honestly use monalect for that. And that's another thing, I originally created Monalect for myself. I'll want to use it.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get this mess of a ramble down to a simple thought:</p>
<p>I'm still learning.</p>
<p>Everything I'm doing here is an iterative process of improvement that will only work if I remain consistent on this project. <em>Which means,</em> I shouldn't stress so much about it. So long as I review and recognize I'm not doing enough, and have the capacity to search for why, then I'm on a path of growth.</p>
<p>But it requires constant work, and I guess knowing what to do next.</p>
<p>So what to do next. Let me re-read what I wrote, and list my conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li>create basic content first</li>
<li>design, and prepare website for domain publication (using the basic content that I've written to make it less empty)</li>
<li>go into marketing, but take it less seriously. it's okay to experiment and be less formal as I explore the field</li>
<li>i'm still learning</li>
</ul>
<p>[6:48pm]</p>
<p>So I'm just going to organize my stuff then. I need to finish my content creation framework, and set an alloted time to work on it.</p>
<p>I'm choosing the morning from 7am-12pm, which is 5 hours. Should be plenty of time. This include any programming work in service to marketting, such as revamping the front-facing site, cleaning up figma, and what not.</p>
<p>I'm leaving 12pm-1pm for eating/cooking, and then I'm focusing on 1pm-9pm for programming. </p>
<p>That should be 13 hours of work. I'll eat while I program. I need to set up an alarm for it, and a more invested way of making sure I stick to it.</p>
<p>I'll be spending the rest of the day preparing for tomorrow. I'll finish the content creatino framework, and set up my marketing tasks for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Because it's sunday, I'll only be programming from 1pm-7pm, so I can spend the rest of my time reviewing and planning the week.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-8">May 8</h2>
<p>[8:21am]</p>
<p>I'm watching a lot of pre-launch marketing videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/GZt2Mz_JrvI">This is a really good one.</a> The idea behind pre-marketing is to get as much users interested in our product as possible, and the measurable factor would be something like signing up onto our email list, or following our social media or blog. The email list being the most valuable because you have the most control over the statistics.</p>
<p>So I guess that's where my goal will be around. Getting people to sign up for our email list.</p>
<p>It'll mean changing the current registration form for a simple email sign-up form that will replace the "Coming Soon", and switching to an invisible recaptcha.</p>
<p>For today, I'll still be working on the content creation framework. I'm a little confused still as to how it should work, but at least I have a time frame to work on this. I'll then create a list of concrete ideas to write on.</p>
<p>I'll also want to spend some time on the courses again, before finally returning to programming which I'm actually looking forward to, today.</p>
<p>[1:31pm]</p>
<p>Okay, I went alittle too much into marketing again. I'm unhappy with the progress I'm making there, it's not enough work for the hours I spend on it. I feel like I'm hovering around in limbo wondering what to do instead of actually doing anything. Hopefully that will change soon.</p>
<p>As for now, it's time to work on coding finally. I have some things I learned to include. I'm going to finally do the clean up, and then I'll move on to doing two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exception handling user registration</li>
<li>SEO optimizations on my website</li>
</ul>
<p>I did an audit on my website for things I can improve upon, which was incredibly helpful. I want to do more audits using some online tools. My performance is good, which is good, and I can do more to improve the bottle necks like the SVG. </p>
<p>I'll want to set-up analytics as well. I know I said I'd spend marketing programming in marketing's time, but I can't do that if I'm spending most of my time in marketing, writing, editing, and researching.</p>
<p>But anyways, lets clean.</p>

</ul>
<p>[6:51pm]</p>
<p>So I did a lot of work. I cleaned up frontend so that it's all integrated with the design system, although it can be improved. I think I did it too much actually. I tried to clean up backend, but found everything rather... already seperated. I did go through the errors, but as I was cleaning up the exception handling, I sort of just questioned the point of it. I was building an api for a frontend that already checked the input.</p>
<p>Anyways, I switched focus to setting up email registration for the frontend site. I'm setting that up right now, I finished the email server that I'm going to deploy at home, through cloudflare. Then I'm going to create the form on frontend, which is already there actually, I just need to set up the fetch request.</p>
<p>It's super basic, super simple. It gives me time to focus on how I'm going to organize everything, so I'm going to set it up and deploy it.</p>
<p>[11:44pm]</p>
<p>Okay, I'm almost done. I forgot my raspberry pi password. I'm not looking forward to hosting my things up on google cloud. I took a look at it, annoyed at how buggy rpi-imager was, and realized that I know nothing about what I'm looking at. </p>
<p>I'll need to go through it pretty well if I ever hope to host it. It's not as easy as just static site hosting, I actually have to care it turns out.</p>
<p>Ugh, I have to reconfigure Apache2 god damn it for mod_wsgi. This is going to be a long night. I'll just do some other things then. I'll have the fresh raspbian install ready-- ugh I just realized I installed the one with the desktop. God damn it. I have to start all over again. </p>
<p>Anyways, I'll set it up and install it tomorrow. I need to try and not ruin my sleep. I ran out of antipsychotics, and my psychiatrist in all his wisdom forgot to refill my prescriptions before he took what I assume is his vacation, as his office is closed for the next 2 weeks. So I have a lot of uppers. I have to be careful not to ruin myself, so I won't stop taking my anti-depressants. I really need monalect finished.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: Set up self-hosting. After that, I'll go back to marketing and I'll be writing a few more ideas, and then start outlining and researching into one of them. Then I'll implement some SEO stuff for marketing, based on the audit. After that, I'll move on to the next user story, which will be user login w/ sessions.</p>
<p>After that, I hope I hope I hope, I can actually get started on the app.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 10.5 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-9">May 9</h2>
<p>[1:50pm]</p>
<p>I am livid. How hard is it to implement something as stupid as captcha, oh my god. I spent all morning setting it up, I have deployment down, but for some god forsaken reason HCaptcha can't send a token worth its own existence. And if it isn't the token, then it's the stupid email.</p>
<p>I hate react, it's the stupidest most incompetent framework created.</p>
<p>I give up. Screw captchas, I'll let anyone submit an email I don't care anymore. It's supposed to be so simple, it's stupid that I spent all morning on this.</p>
<p>I can't do it anymore, I have to step back. Tomorrow I'll just bite the bullet and set up recaptcha enterprise, I give up. This problem absolutely demotivated me.</p>
<p>I'm moving on to what I wanted to do before, which was marketing and some SEO optimizations for my website. The email subscription list will just have to wait. </p>
<p>[2:02pm]</p>
<p>Oh my god, it turns out google recaptcha still allows you to create recaptcha v2, but it's on their admin console, I want to die. </p>
<p>I'm going to take a break then, I'll be back in 15 minutes after cooling off.</p>
<p>[3:44pm]</p>
<p>Did it and it works, but it's still a little broken. For example, if the textbox is autofilled, then it'll ignore it completely. I'm just going to try and do the old form data stuff and see if that works out. I'll also want to telegraph and design the success/failure a little better.</p>
<p>But all in good time.</p>
<p>For now, I'm going to get back to marketing.</p>
<p>For ideas, I have question as to what I should do. In the beginning, I really just want to write about whatever and start philosophizing, which is not good. I'll want to go with basic easy subjects to make ti easier for myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top 5 Self-learning Resources</li>
<li>Creating your own course</li>
<li>How university has become a debt-trap.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I said I wouldn't get into the whole anti-schooling thing, but I absolutely love the idea of replacing university with my app. It gives me a really high standard. If I can create a pathway from simple online resources to academia, the long arduous journey, then I've really accomplished something.</p>
<p>The first topic has to have a mix of passion and ease. </p>
<p>Autodidacticism. Self-learning. The wall for education is broken, and you have no excuse not to study. That's what I really want to do. It can be titled, "How you can study anything without going to unviersity" or something like that. I'll get started on outlining and such.</p>
<p>[9:06pm]</p>
<p>I looked over some of the SEO stuff, and realized I have no will to go back to it right now. I created the outline for my first blogpost and started ranting it out, now I'm working on designs for the coming forms for the app itself.</p>
<p>I thought I could skip over user creation and make a demo site for showing it off.</p>
<p>Either way I'm winding down. I didn't sleep well last night. I didn't do as much work as I'd hoped due to how long deploying email subscription took, but it's okay. So long as I <em>did it</em>. I might need to create a new branch for my frontend so I can integrate backend into one of them, but I fear what would happen if I mix up the code. I'm just going to make it very modular, I just disconnect it when I deploy it, and name the pages something random.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I should follow my schedule pretty strictly though. For the morning, I'll list and integrate the SEO stuff, and then work on my blog post. For the afternoon, I'll want to set up backend and the design for the course object, specifically its CRUD.</p>
<p>It means getting down and dirty with graphql again. I wonder how I'd implement a demo user? I thought there should just be a user named "demo" that everything is attached to in a simple sqlite database. Registration capabilities won't exist, making them the only user. Any changes made will have to be reverted or just thrown away and mocked on front-end. That means in backend, the demo user has two modes: production and development. In development, you can do CRUD to test out those CRUD functions during integration testing, but in production, they're just thrown out and faked.</p>
<p>Of course, this is for the demo, before any user login and authorization takes place.</p>
<p>That will be its own confusion.</p>
<p>But I'm typing myself out, I'll be back tomorrow morning. Till then!</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 8 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-10">May 10</h2>
<p>[6:42am]</p>
<p>Time is moving too fast. It's already May 10th, I'm surprised. Today I'm going to be working on what I said I'd do yesterday. It'll be pretty uneventful. I'll try to complete everything as fast as I can so I can sit down and get started thinking about the app itself.</p>
<p>I want to read other people's React code and see how more I can improve it.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be in line with what I'm doing. I'm using far more states than I know to. I have a few problems as well, such as getting value.</p>
<p>[7:38am]</p>
<p>I'll have to sort the items on the audit. </p>
<p>(List Pasted to May 11)</p>
<p>[9:16am]</p>
<p>I'm going to move on to writing my blog post. SEO is fun, but I'm hesitant on sharing my website until I can have good content up there. Sharing to my close and personals, that is.</p>
<p>I want to switch focus over onto from a learning management system, to a textbook study tool. Or no... that makes it less than it is. Course manager?
I think that's the closest to it. A course manager. Create, manage, and study your courses.</p>
<p>With it, you can read and write notes, test yourself, etc. It's not neccesarily a self-learning management system, it's a course manager. That's perfect.</p>
<p>But I can't then go into autodidacticism and anti-schooling. Maybe I still can? I don't want to hurt my product by giving it a lot of political or ideological baggage. I'll still go through my original blog post with fervor though, and then I'll care about that.</p>
<p>I might spend a few more hours actually on re-aligning the content to that new framing.</p>
<p>[3:18pm]</p>
<p>Finished writing the rough draft. Writing articles is going to be an increasingly bigger problem. The act of writing can get uncomfortable, and unlike programming where I'm solving a problem, it's much easier to move on and procrastinate. </p>
<p>So when writing, I want to create a different environment. I might just write it by hand.</p>
<p>But anyways, time to focus on programming now. What did I say I'd do? Ah, yes. The course object. Course creation and modification, and then some design work for the UI. I'll actually work on that then, and at night I want to finish the SEO checklist. </p>
<p>Then I'll need to allot some time to cleaning my code again. I'll want to create a checklist for that, and I'll want to do it by the end of the week. As I program, I'll onto it in the procrastination file. </p>
<p>[5:57pm]</p>
<p>I'm realizing that I have to do a bit more planning on the user story. I started off with course creation, but course creation itself has to come from an environment.</p>
<p>I'll finish implementing the stuff for now.</p>
<p>[7:43pm]</p>
<p>I don't think I can work anymore. I have a problem with my psychiatry medication. My psychiatrist didn't refill my antipsychotic, and I've been off it for 2 or 3 days, and now I'm going through withdrawal. It's so far just an experience of intense depression. I'm falling into the habit of being on my phone too long, or scrolling through reddit trying to find stimulation.</p>
<p>The problem is, I don't think I want to take my antipsychotic anymore. It's caused me tardive dyskinesia, which has a chance in becoming permanent, so I'm stopping it. I don't know why, but every antipsychotic I take, I somehow get bad side effects. With abilify it was weight gain, and now with Latuda it's involuntary tics. </p>
<p>It's making me tired of psychiatry. I have two anti-depressants, one leftover, and a new one. I'm hoping that they will carry me through, but we'll see. It has a chance to severely impact my thinking, as such I'm going to have to go into "lockdown" on my life. I'm going to block websites, ban my phone. I'll need to go outside again, exercise, and be diligent with sleep.</p>
<p>Life is going to be very hard again. It's a great annoyance. Why god gave me this illness, I don't know. There's no way to describe the horror of not being in control of your own mind. I can see myself deteriorating, split between the eyes of sanity and insanity.</p>
<p>[9:04pm]</p>
<p>I feel marginally better. I'm going to keep working again.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 6 hours</strong></p>
<h2 id="may-11">May 11</h2>
<p>[4:18am]</p>
<p>Ugghughgghhgh. I slept at 10:30pm, woke up at 3:30am. I'm unable to sleep again. I figure I'll use the time to work, but this isn't good. Sleep is usually the greatest factor in my mental wellbeing. If I struggle with it, it's not a good sign.</p>
<p>The good news is that I tried going from 0.5mg to 1mg of melatonin, and it worked really well. Much better than just 0.5mg, and it really hit 30-60 minutes after I took it. It has a good chance of replacing Latuda's helpful side effect of causing me to sleep.</p>
<p>I think I can do this. </p>
<p>[11:32am]</p>
<p>Didn't do much, just three hours work focusing on my blog post. There was a power outage for a second early morning, but it went by.</p>
<p>Now I'm going back to focusing on programming, but I want to talk a bit about my blog post.</p>
<p>I became interested in writing it, but made it more of a mess. I turned it from 1600 words into 2600 words by pure ranting, and organized it up a bit. I want to print it out and do some hand-editing, but I think I want to find a way to edit on the computer.</p>
<p>I might actually nap a little first, or rest my eyes.</p>
<p>Anyways, after that, I really want to finish the frontend work that I told myself I'd do. I want to show it off to my parents, but I need to work into marketing a bit more, and put out my reworked vision statement.</p>
<p>For now, I'll finish the course stuff I said I'd do yesterday, and then create a list for the dashboard and general structure around course creation before going into course creation itself.</p>
<p>I'll start with the design first of that part. I have it in my head. A pull-out menu to the side that shows your courses, while the navigation header takes you to your notebook, textbook, etc. I still want to decide on how I want to show it.</p>
<p>I thought originally to merge the text reader and notebook into a single page for "study", but I want to be able to middle-click the link have the text reader open in a new tab if I wanted to split windows instead of split-view inside the app itself. This allows me to use multiple monitors.</p>
<p>[2:05pm]</p>
<p>Took a little nap. Just sat my head back in bed. There's something strange about sleeping on my back, where I just nod in and out of sleep. It's the closest I'll ever get to feeling high.</p>
<p>But anyways I have work to do. I finished the course object creation, and updateing. Now I just got to do deleting, and reading, but it's turning out to be very easy. I worry though it's just putting more work on frontend. In backend, it's easy to respond with the initial query for everything on a page. But creating a giant graphql query in frontend just to send it it, is not going to be very fun.</p>

<p>[4:30pm]</p>
<p>All done. It's so cool, I really want to show it off to friends and family. There's going to be a lot of optimization, design, and clean up work to do eventually, but I'm really proud of my work so far. </p>
<p>I'll really only focus on marketing. I can't wait until I get enough content that I can improve the site again. For the next few days, it's just the app and marketing. So a lot of grunt work.</p>
<p>I don't want to get into the dashboard right now. I want to actually focus on the content a bit before going into it. </p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 6 hours</strong></p>
<h3 id="may-12">May 12</h3>
<p>[9:02am]</p>
<p>Ugh, it's almost May 14. I don't know why I keep dreading that date. It's when I have to get a cavity filled, which shouldn't be so stressful. It's just a cavity filling. I think it's the money worries.</p>
<p>I woke up early today at around 6am, sleeping a bit better. It just took some time because I had some friendship drama. But now I only have work before me.</p>
<p>Morning: Marketing. Work on the blog post, and then the vision statement. </p>
<p>After that, we have the design work. There are some things I have to clean up. Namely, set things up in Figma to become a proper design system with components I can use to begin designing the app.</p>
<p>I then design the dashboard. The dashboard will go from the structure to the course creation itself. Anything involving file uploads will be ignored, so for example the questions jsons and and the textbook file uploads. I'll create the components, then move on to front-end or back-end, depending on what I'm feeling. After that, integration.</p>
<p>Lets go.</p>
<p>[1:12pm]</p>
<p>I feel so tired, and demotivated. Worse than yesterday. I don't know if it's the sleep or the withdrawal, it's getting scary.</p>
<p>I'm going to remove a lot of things now. I'm finding myself scrolling too much. I'm going to nap as well. I'll be back.</p>
<p>[3:46pm]</p>
<p>I took a nap, again, and feel a bit more motivated. I really do think it's just lack of sleep now. I close my eyes for thirty minutes, and I wake up feeling normal again.</p>
<p>It's going to mean I have to be very diligent with my sleep. I don't want to ruin it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I spent an hour on the dashboard now, and the design is coming to me through frustration. I might want to do some paper layouts, and then moving on to implementing it in figma. The color scheme is annoying as well.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm making it very simple since it's just the initial dashboard, but I still have to make it look nice. </p>
<p>In the future, I'm going to implement tabs for when I eventually implement a curricula or subject structure, to organize these subjects in.</p>
<p>I'm looking at other examples. Courses on EdX and Coursera. I'm also looking at Quizlet's cards. The issue with their setup is that they're vendors showing off many complicated different things. Quizlet isn't, but their cards are very small. I want my courses to feel very big, and static so that when the user doesn't feel comfortable modifying their courses.</p>
<p>[9:06pm] </p>
<p>I didn't work well today. I'm very annoyed about it. I'm going to have to change things, this isn't good.</p>
<p>But it's time for me to try and sleep. I don't want to ruin it.</p>
<p>I'll be back tomorrow to work and make up all this lost time, mark my words.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 4.5 hours</strong></p>
<h3 id="may-13">May 13</h3>
<p>[2:40pm]</p>
<p>Not a good start. I mostly spent time watching old Johnny Carson interviews. But I did sleep fairly well. I'm going to get a start today on course creation. A question I'm having is with regards to the switch from course overview to course creation. I can use a modal popup, or I can use a different web page. I'll go with a modal.</p>
<p>[5:00pm]</p>
<p>I'm incredibly frustrated with the design. I'm not using Figma as good as I should. I'm cutting corners, doing things lazily. God damn it. I want to break everything down again.</p>
<p>It's not good enough. </p>
<p>But I'm going to push through it. So long as I build it and work. I'll revisit the design later, I just want to use this damn app.</p>
<p><strong>Time Worked: 3 hours</strong></p>
<h3 id="may-14">May 14</h3>
<p>[9:15am]</p>
<p>I feel much better now. It really was sleep. It turns out sleeping 4 or 5 disjointed hours every day for a few days can really ruin your motivation, who would've thought. I'm sleeping much better now as the withdrawal wears off.</p>
<p>One worry is the fact that I'm having more and more trouble trying to fall asleep, likely due to the wellbutrin, which I ran out of today and need to get a refill on somehow. I'll see. I still have the Lexapro to survive off of, which will definitely rein true hell upon my sleep. So I'm going to try and see my family doctor and get a refill on it, maybe without taking it for a day or two.</p>
<p>But for now, I can do things. I'm frustrated with the design still, it feels incredibly amateurish again, which is not what I felt before.</p>
<p>I want to go back and rehaul everything before I move on to creating my app. My primary issue is with the color scheme, and the general "feel" of it. While I enjoy the lightness, and it's pretty formal, it's not "correct". For one, I'm unhappy with using a gradient for the background, which I did to add variety to my background, so it isn't just blank. However, it's making it very hard to play around with my color scheme.</p>
<p>I would honestly choose black and white shades if I could just for ease of use, but I need color psychology in my design. </p>
<p>One thing I'd like to add is to my email database which is a test@gmail.com account that allows you to just test if it works, and then throw it out.</p>
<p>But yea, I'm going to ignore marketing for this morning, as I have a dentist appoint at 10:30am, which I'm leaving for at 10am. </p>
<p>But for today, it's just entirely design. I have to put myself in the design headspace again. Moodboards, aesthetic, peace. I've been listening to generative synthesis mixes, which is a really clean headspace. I'm unsure if it's for education however. In Islam, there's a taboo against showing images of faces and creatures in art. The idea, aside from idolatry which is the more severe reason, is that you're trying to mimic god. It's very Platonic now that I think about it, but it gives a lot of things in islam a very "inhuman", or "background" sort of feel. Like what you're using, whether it's a building, or a prayer mat, or a book, is just an object to use.</p>
<p>Unless they're meditated upon, it's rather boring. They can be beautiful, but you can't go "oh, that's a person doing something", there's no story to recognize. It makes it very unidimensional on the surface, but the beauty in islamic art is just how well they make the most of those restrictions. They rely heavily on complexity, composition, size, form, color, and light to drive emotion. </p>
<p>It's hidden complexity as an art.</p>
<p>I really want to be inspired by that, because that's what my web design aims are. The website I make is supposed to serve a function, it's not supposed to be something the user sees but "feels" as they navigate through the user experience. Whether that's instructing or informing the user, or providing the user your web service.</p>
<p>Imagery can distract from that, but visuals can help, for example in instruction, but those visuals are often very clearly there for the user to see and are fairly active active.</p>
<p>Another thing is I see a lot of graphics design on Dribbble as overly trendy. Everyone is copying each other, you rarely find an interesting and unique take on things unless you actively google it and see examples in those top ten lists.</p>
<p>[9:47am]</p>
<p>Now looking over my own website design, I'm going to criticize it and see what I can do to change it. I spoke on the color scheme before, but the color scheme itself doesn't really bother me. I rather enjoy the blue color scheme, but I don't enjoy the gradient, as I've already said.</p>
<p>One thing I enjoy is the use of color in the different pages, which is done by using different gradients with one constant color, and another differing color. The blog page feels different than the landing page.</p>
<p>What I don't enjoy is how minimal it is. It's minimal because of the lack of content, caused by the lack of character-building on my part. There's nothing much I can do about that. </p>
<h4 id="grounding-myself-to-reality">Grounding Myself to Reality</h4>
<p>But anyways, after some quick thought, I want to say that I'm not going to overhaul the changes now. I think the reason why I'm frustrated is because I'm thinking the design now is not "usable", which is rather understandable. I'm just making the thing.</p>
<p>But I do want to revisit the design. A lot of the frustration comes from an insecurity in how people will perceive it, which I personally think is fine, it pushes me to make it a lot better rather than be content with poor quality, or mediocrity. It just shouldn't stand in the way of actually building it, and ignoring the idea that I can eventually improve it anyways.</p>
<p>So I'm going to make sure things are set up so that they can be built properly.</p>
<p>[11:27am]</p>
<p>Okay my mouth is numb, and my mind is fresh. I want to work on course CRUD still, just to have it done. But the work is surprisingly quick, save for the annoyance with design.</p>
